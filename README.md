*This repository provides a straightforward guide for converting the Elegoo Neptune 3 MAX 3D Printer to run on Klipper firmware. Here, you'll find useful configuration files, macros, setup guides, and other resources to streamline the conversion process and get your printer up and running with (hopefully) minimal hassle.*
<br><br>
## Why Klipper?
Klipper is a powerful 3D printer firmware that enhances performance by offloading computation from the printer’s mainboard to an external computer (most often, a Raspberry Pi). This improves print quality, enables faster speeds, and provides advanced features such as smoother motion control and greater configurability.
